# EnemyThatFollowsPlayer
This tutorial will demonstrate how to program an enemy that follows the player in Unity 3D using C#. This will also cover how to set up the Unity 3D environment, as well as common practices when writing scripts.

1. Create a new Unity project using the Universal 3D pipeline and name it "EnemyThatFollowsPlayerTut".

2. Once the Unity project has loaded, start by creating a terrain for our game objects to be on as we will be adding gravity to our game objects through rigidbody components.
